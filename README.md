# LabView Tools

[LabVIEW NXG](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview/labview-nxg.html) is the next generation of LabVIEW that quickly automates your hardware, customizing tests to your specifications, and easily viewing measurement results from anywhere.

[LabVIEW NXG Web Module](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/add-ons-for-electronic-test-and-instrumentation/what-is-labview-nxg-web-module.html) allows the creation of web-based user interfaces for LabVIEW and LabVIEW NXG applications without the need for web development skills.

[LabVIEW FPGA Module](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/add-ons-for-electronic-test-and-instrumentation/what-is-labview-fpga-module.html) allows the user to develop FPGA VIs on a host computer and compile and implement the code on NI reconfigurable I/O (RIO) hardware. 

[LabVIEW Real-Time Module](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/data-acquisition-and-control/add-ons-for-data-acquisition-and-control/what-is-labview-real-time-module.html) allows the user to create and debug reliable, deterministic applications that run on stand-alone embedded hardware targets.

[Vision Development Module](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/data-acquisition-and-control/add-ons-for-data-acquisition-and-control/what-is-vision-development-module.html) is an add-on that provides hundreds of functions for developing and deploying machine vision applications.

[npTDMS](https://github.com/adamreeve/npTDMS) is a cross-platform Python package for reading and writing TDMS files as produced by LabVIEW, and is built on top of the [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) package.

[Featherweight](https://github.com/featherweight/featherweight) is an Application Framework for NI LabVIEWâ„¢.

[LV-MQTT-Broker](https://github.com/LabVIEW-Open-Source/LV-MQTT-Broker) is the native LabVIEW MQTT Broker Server.
